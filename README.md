Installed the following dependencies:

- mysql2

## Usage

This application can be used to track various information about the employees of a given workplace. Using the application you can track employee first and last name, salary, specific role and ID, as well as their department and what manager personnel the searched employee reports to.

## Struggles
- I was not able to properly get the functions to work in inquirer. WHen the menu select init function is run, you are able to see the first options to select but cannot move past that start menu section.
- I'm also not able to get my employee table to generate in the schema.sql file. No matter what I do to chage the syntax and what corrections I try the table will not populate in the mysql environment. 
- I will continue to try to work on this project after submission to attempt to fix the issues I'm running into.
